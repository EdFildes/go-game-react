Go game react

- decideded to go with typescript because of the object oriented nature of board games
- decided on styled components because I felt there would be a small number of components of which there were unlikely to be multiple variations. So styled components seemed like a tidier approach
- approached the styling of the Tiles using clip path, asked chatgpt after the fact what it approach it would have taken and it was pretty inisistent on SVG. I don't have much experience of SVG, so it would be
cool to try that out but clip path seems to be working ok for now so I'll run with it.

- the code for the  looked far worse than I remembered and a lot of it didn't work so great so I started writing some tests
- Had been to a TDD event recently and wanted to use some of the discoveries from that

- The game was sort of working in vanilla JS with the game engine in node but it meant different games weren't isolated
- Thought react would mean things could be far more easily self contained, Plus it can be hosted on github pages

- At a certain point I kept refactoring again and again because I couldn't get the class/function structure quite right so I decided to 
go back to pen and paper and map out what everything was supposed to be doing first and then not exactly starting from scratch but going back to basics

- I opted for looping through neighbouring stones a several times each turn instead of just once just to separate stages a bit more
